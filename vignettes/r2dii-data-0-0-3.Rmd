We're excited to announce that r2dii.data is now on CRAN.

Because both financial institutions and market data providers keep their
data private, this package provides fake, public data to enable the
development and use in R of PACTA (Paris Agreement Capital Transition
Assessment) – a free tool that calculates the alignment between
financial assets and climate scenarios
(<a href="https://www.transitionmonitor.com/" class="uri">https://www.transitionmonitor.com/</a>).

Install r2dii.data with:

    install.packages("r2dii.data")

And use it with:

    library(r2dii.data)

[`data_dictionary`](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.data/reference/data_dictionary.html)
provides metadata about all datasets in r2dii.data.

    # Optional: Use tibble to print nice data frames
    library(tibble)

Tips:

-   Use the package [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) to
    automatically print nice data frames.
-   Explore all datasets at the [website of
    r2dii.data](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.data/index.html),
    under the tab
    [Reference](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.data/reference/index.html).
-   Use `utils::View()` in RStudio to search, sort, and filter keywords.
