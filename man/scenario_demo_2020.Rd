\title{A prepared climate scenario dataset for demonstration}
\format{
An object of class \code{tbl_df} (inherits from \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 1512 rows and 8 columns.
}
\usage{
scenario_demo_2020
}
\description{
Fake climate scenario dataset, prepared for the software PACTA (Paris
Agreement Capital Transition Assessment). It imitates climate scenario data
(e.g. from the International Energy Agency (IEA)) including the change
through time in production across industrial sectors (calculated by
\href{https://2degrees-investing.org/}{2DII}).

Demo datasets are synthetic because most financial data is strictly private;
they help to demonstrate and test the implementation in R of 'PACTA'
(\url{https://2degrees-investing.org/resource/pacta/}).
