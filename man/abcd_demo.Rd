\title{An asset-based company dataset for demonstration}
\format{
An object of class \code{tbl_df} (inherits from \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 4972 rows and 14 columns.
}
\usage{
abcd_demo
}
\description{
Fake data about physical assets (e.g. wind turbine power plant
capacities), aggregated to company-level. These data are used to assess the
climate alignment of financial portfolios. It imitates data from
market-intelligence databases.

Demo datasets are synthetic because most financial data is strictly private;
they help to demonstrate and test the implementation in R of 'PACTA'
(\url{https://www.transitionmonitor.com/}).
